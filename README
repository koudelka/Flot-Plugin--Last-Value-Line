  === Flot Last Value Line

  == Adds a horizontal line across the chart, at the height of the last value.

  == Usage
    - If left alone, the plugin will automatically figure view options based
      on each series' various settings. (same color, half the width, 75% alpha)

    - If you wish to turn on only specific series, you can simply provide an
      array of series indicies to options['last_value_line']['series']

    - Examples:

      To turn on only series zero and four, with automatic view options:

      last_value_line: {
        series: [0, 4]
      }

      To turn on series zero, with a white, half-transparent, 10-thick line:

      last_value_line: {
        series: {
          0: {
            color: '#ffffff',
            alpha: 0.5,
            width: 10
          }
        }
      }
